Experiment with new library: "openframeworks" [openframeworks.cc]
To see if it can be used to create visualisations of EEG signal obtained by the EEG-kiss application. Needs to have support for ""opensound control".

- Download release 0.8.4 for Windows code::blocks (http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.8.4/of_v0.8.4_win_cb_release.zip)
- Extract to: "C:\Data\Projects\eeg-kiss\of_v0.8.4_win_cb_release"
- Read file "..\INSTALL.md"
- Follow steps on "http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/codeblocks":
    * download from [http://fossies.org/windows/misc/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe/] i.s.o. indicated link (to prevent unnecessary add-ons)
    * install code blocks IDE: full options (may check shortcut generation settings)
    * a popup appears for selecting default compiler, default GNUCC is Ok (?)
    * after first launch you probably don't want the IDE to change file associations
    * download additions here: http://www.openframeworks.cc/content/files/codeblocks_additions.zip
    * and follow the steps from the included readme-file:
        - add the contents of the folder "add_to_codeblocks_mingw_include" into "C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include" (or wherever your app\mingw\include is)
        - add the contents of the folder "add_to_codeblocks_mingw_lib" into "C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib"(or wherever your app\mingw\lib is)
